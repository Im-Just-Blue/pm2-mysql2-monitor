## Description

PM2 module to monitor a MySQL server with Keymetrics

## Install

`pm2 install pm2-mysql`

## Requirements

This module requires a MySQL install (tested against v5.6). Optionally, to monitor the DB disk Read/Write you will need `iostat` located in the `sysstat` package.

### Slow Queries

To be able to display Slow Queries you first need to activate slow_query_log in MySQL via :
Edit /etc/mysql/my.cnf and add : 
slow_query_log = '1'

and you need to set the log file path to a file your pm2 user has read access to : 
slow_query_log_file = '/var/log/mysql/slow-queries.log'

### General Query Log

To be able to display the last queries, you need to enable the General Query Log via :
general_log = '1'

and you need to set the log file path to a file your pm2 user has read access to : 
general_log_file = '/var/log/mysql/general.log'
